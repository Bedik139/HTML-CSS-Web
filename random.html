                    Let's talk about my current favorite movie the prestige,
                    directed by Christopher Nolan starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale.

                    from the beginning or first 15 minutes there were two main characters. 
                    Angier and Borden, which at the first scene Borden was imprisoned because 
                    he "killed" Angier then a classic Christopher Nolan blocking is illustrated 
                    which involves different timeline of each scenario, it was later revealed in
                    the movie that the root of Angier and Borden's rival was because Borden allegedly
                    tried a different tie of Knot to Angier's wife which was Angier's assistant magician
                    as well. I was not expecting the plot twist at the end, making it one of my and my 
                    favorite movie today.
